## Requirements
This project is developed on Python. In order it you will need the following python-packages installed. You can download 
and install them via `pip` tool.
- numpy
- sklearn
- scipy
- metrics
- pandas
- keras (for running NN)
- tensorflow (for running NN)

## Runing Project
In order to run the project, inside the project root folder call the run.py with a project name argument. By running each project it will run and illustrate its results.
 
 ```bash
python run.py PROJECT_NAME
 ``` 
 Where `PROJECT_NAME` could be one of these:
 
 - `classification` or `cl` for running Classification
 - `bench-mark` or `bm` for running Bench-Mark
 - `feature-selection` or `fs` for running Feature Selection on regression data
 - `linear-regression` or `lr` for running Linear Regression
 - `reg-all` for running all Regression based modules
 - `kmeans` or `km` for running k-means clustering
 - `hierarchical-clustering` or `hc` for running Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative-Clustering)
 - `neural-networks` or `nn` for running Neural Network Classification

You can also run these commands for running projects based on the part theyâ€™re described in:

 - `p1` for running part #1 (Regression)
 - `p2` for running part #2 (Classification)
 - `p3` for running part #3 (SVM)
 - `p4` for running part #4 (Clustering)
 - `p5` for running part #5 (Neural Network)
